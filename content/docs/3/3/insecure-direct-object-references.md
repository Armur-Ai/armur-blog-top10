## Introduction to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) are a type of access control vulnerability that arises when an application exposes internal object references directly to users without proper authorization checks. These references, often in the form of numerical IDs or keys, can be used to identify and access resources such as database records, files, or user profiles. 

If an application fails to validate whether a user is authorized to access a specific object based on its reference, attackers can manipulate these references to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## How IDOR Works

Consider a web application that displays user profiles using URLs like this:

```
https://example.com/profile.php?user_id=123
```

If the application doesn't verify whether the logged-in user is authorized to view the profile with `user_id=123`, an attacker could simply modify the `user_id` parameter to access other users' profiles:

```
https://example.com/profile.php?user_id=456 
```

This would potentially reveal sensitive information belonging to another user.

## Types of IDOR Vulnerabilities

IDOR vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms:

* **Predictable IDs:** Applications that use sequential or easily guessable IDs (e.g., incrementing integers) make it easy for attackers to enumerate and access different objects.
* **Hidden IDs:** Even if IDs are not directly visible in URLs, they might be present in hidden form fields or other parts of the application's code, making them vulnerable to manipulation.
* **References in APIs:** REST APIs often use IDs to identify resources, making them susceptible to IDOR attacks if not properly secured.
* **File System Access:** IDOR can also be used to access files on the server if the application uses predictable file paths or allows users to manipulate file names directly.


## Practical Example: Exploiting an E-commerce Website

Imagine an e-commerce website where users can view their order history through URLs like this:

```
https://example.com/orders.php?order_id=1001
```

If the application doesn't enforce proper access control, an attacker could modify the `order_id` to view other users' orders, potentially revealing their personal information, addresses, and purchase history.

## Detecting and Preventing IDOR Vulnerabilities

**Detection:**

* **Analyze application URLs and parameters:** Look for patterns that suggest object references are being used.
* **Test for predictable ID sequences:** Try incrementing or decrementing ID values to see if different objects can be accessed.
* **Inspect HTTP requests and responses:** Analyze the data exchanged between the client and server to identify potential object references.
* **Use automated vulnerability scanners:**  Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP can help identify potential IDOR vulnerabilities.


**Prevention:**

* **Implement robust access control mechanisms:** Verify that the user is authorized to access the specific object before retrieving or displaying its data.
* **Use unpredictable, randomized IDs:** Avoid using sequential or easily guessable identifiers.
* **Implement indirect object references:** Instead of directly exposing object IDs, use a mapping mechanism to translate user-provided input into internal object references.
* **Validate user inputs:**  Ensure that user-supplied values for object references are within the expected range and format.
* **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing:** Identify and address IDOR vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Conclusion

Insecure Direct Object References are a common and often overlooked vulnerability that can have serious consequences for web application security. By understanding how IDOR works and implementing effective prevention measures, developers can protect their applications and users from unauthorized data access.
